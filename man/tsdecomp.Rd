\title{Time Scale Decomposition}
\usage{
tsdecomp(x, breaks)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector with no missing data}

\item{breaks}{a numeric constant or a vector of break points into which \code{x} should be broken. If breaks is a constant then \code{x} will be broken into that number of frequncies. This argument is passed directly to \code{cut} to determine the break points. See \code{cut} for more details.}
}
\value{
A matrix with dimension n x m where n is the length of \code{x} and m is the number of break categories.
}
\description{
Decompose a vector into frequency components
}
\examples{
x <- rnorm(101)
freq.x <- tsdecomp(x, c(1, 10, 30, 80))

## decompose x into 3 frequency categories.
## x[,1] represents from 1 to 9 cycles in 101 data points
## x[,2] represents from 10 to 29 cycles in 101 data points
## x[,3] represents from 30 to 50 cycles in 101 data points
## you can only have up to 50 cycles in 101 data points.
